# Multi Person Pose Estimation with PyTorch
[HigherHRNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10357) architecture implemented and trained from scratch using ImageNet and COCO datasets.
The model is trained in two steps:
1. Backbone pretraining on ImageNet dataset (_ClassificationHRNet_)
2. Training on COCO (_HigherHRNet_)
